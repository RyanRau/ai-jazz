# ryanzrau

The personal site at [ryanzrau.dev](https://ryanzrau.dev) — the root-domain app
(`subdomain: ""` in the repo-root `deploy.yml`).

Currently a placeholder: a heading and a bluestar `Button`.

## Local development

```bash
npm run bootstrap            # once per clone, from the repo root: builds bluestar
cd apps/ryanzrau
npm install
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:5173
npm run build                # type-check + production build into dist/
```

After changing `packages/bluestar`, rebuild it (`npm --prefix packages/bluestar run build`)
so this app picks up the change — apps import bluestar's `dist/`, not its source.

## Stack

React + TypeScript + Vite, with [bluestar](../../packages/bluestar) for UI.
It has no backend integration yet; if it needs data, use the PocketBase SDK the
same way scaffolded apps do (see `apps/pocketbase/README.md`).

## Deployment

Built by the two-stage `Dockerfile` here (bluestar → app → nginx) and served by
`nginx.conf`. Pushing to `main` builds and deploys it.
